# Introduction {#introduction}
This is a introduction to my data in R.

## Starting with RStudio
Introduction to RStudio

### Opening RStudio
Three subheadings might be too much

You can add **bold text** or __bold text with two underscores__
You can also use *italics* with _single underscores_
Adding superscript ^isalsoeasy^
Adding subscript using ~tildesign~

If you add inline code use the backtick `to write code`

Use strikethrough text ~~double~~ tilde

If you're writing a lot of text 
then you might want to break it up.

But if you have a long sentence 

Another way is to use the \

backslash

we have covered this in the [introduction section](#introduction).

you can also create [links to google](https://www.google.com).

But you might have some link to the footnote [^1].

[^1]: This is my first footnote

## Lists

Ordered lists take numbers

1. Item a
2. Item b
3. item c

You can also have unordered lists

- Item A
- Item B

- [ ] 
- [x]

## Tables

You can create tables using | ~

| Column header | Another column | 
| ------------- |----------------|
| First row     | With info      |
| More rows     | With more info |

> A greater than sign creates blocks

How does that look?

How would we highlight code?

Single `backticks` are used in line.

```
print("hello")
read.csv("data.txt")
```

```{r}
75 * 8
```

```{r}
calculation_output <- 100 * 2

calculation_output * 5
```

```{r}
download.file(url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cambiotraining/reproducibility-training/master/data/gapminder_data.csv", destfile="data/gapminder_data.csv")
```
